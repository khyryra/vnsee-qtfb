VNSee-QTFB is a [VNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing) client for the [reMarkable tablet](https://remarkable.com) allowing you to use the device as a second screen or view a desktop environment running on your device. This is a fork of [VNSee](https://github.com/matteodelabre/vnsee) that has been ported to QTFB to enhance performance and compatibility, and has many new features and fixes.
